I'm a computer science graduate from a Russel Group university (2020) and now I'm working for TryHackMe

Some of the things I'm more well known for include:

* [Ciphey](https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey), an automated decryption tool. Input encrypted text (hashed, encrypted, encoded, compressed, in an esolang) and Ciphey will use artificial intelligence to automatically decode it within seconds.
* [My work with TryHackMe](https://www.reddit.com/user/beesec), which has included roles such as Support Specialist, Lead Subreddiit Moderator, Discord Moderator, Bot Developer, Content Creator and more.
* [RustScan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) The Modern Port Scanner. Can complete entire port scans in less than a second, scripting engine supports Python, Shell and Perl. Featured at Defcon & many other conferences.
* [This blog](https://polymath.cloud/) which has 2.3 million views and has been featured #1 on HackerNews many times. Dev.to distinguished Author, HackerNoon author & more awards.
* [My Newsletter](https://polymath.cloud/category/technologically-clairvoyant) with 6000+ subscribers.
* [The 5 books I have written](https://polymath.cloud/category/ebook/) some being sold in major national booksellers as physical books.
* [My open source work](https://github.com/bee-san). Other than pentesting, you'll find me contributing to AI projects such as [TL;DR News](https://github.com/bee-san/tldr-News), [Stegkraken](https://github.com/StegKraken/StegKraken) and more.
