# Total Cost of Ownership
The Total Cost of Ownership (ToC) calculator is a free calculator to compare AWS cloud and on-premise costs. It's designed for anyone who is considering migrating to AWS.

It creates a report after we complete a short questionaire.

The report will include estimated on-premise costs such as:
* Server hardware
* Network hardware
* Power and cooling costs
* Data center space
* Cost of IT personnel
* **Based on assumption costs**

## Spend Summary Graph

## Spend by Service & Service by Spend

Spend by service shows **percentages of total cost**.
Service by spend shows **amounts spent on service**.
